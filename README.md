# StageSync

![Work in Progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-WIP-yellow)

*This project is currently very much a work in progress, and far from completion.*

**StageSync** is an artist booking dashboard designed for booking agencies to streamline their workflow. With StageSync, agencies can easily manage ongoing bookings, track outstanding invoices, and update artist profiles all in one place. The app combines a powerful Rust backend for efficient, secure data handling with a modern, dynamic React (JavaScript) frontend to deliver a smooth, intuitive user experience.

This project aims to simplify the day-to-day tasks of booking agents, ensuring they have a clear overview of upcoming events, artist details, and financials, all within a user-friendly interface.
